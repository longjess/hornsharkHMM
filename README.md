# hornsharkHMM
Functions for Analyzing Horn Shark Data Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

This package provides functions for simulating data from and fitting data to a variety of normal HMMs. The HMMs covered include univariate and multivariate normal HMMs, with and without autoregressive structures. For the multivariate HMMs, there are also functions that additionally assume independence between the variables.

There are also functions for exploring accelerometer data on horn shark movement gathered from a lab environment. The data includes dynamic and static acceleration data, ODBA, timestamps, and behavior labels. There are functions to produce a variety of plots, including histographs, line graphs, and correlation plots. There are also functions for plotting the mean and log SD of the acceleration data.
